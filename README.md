Parameter explaination:
alpha1    =   Forgetting coefficient 1 (decay rate of love of individual 1 in absence of partner)
alpha2    =   Forgetting coefficient 2
beta1     =   Reactiveness to love of 2 on 1 (influence of the partner's love on an individual's feelings)
beta2     =   Reactiveness to love of 1 on 2
gamma1    =   Reactiveness to appeal of 2 on 1 (influence of the partner's appeal on an individual's feelings)
gamma2    =   Reactiveness to appeal of 1 on 2
bA1       =   Bias coefficient of individual 1 (how much individual 1 is biased towards their partner, > 0 for synergic, 0 for unbiased, < 0 for platonic)
bA2       =   Bias coefficient of individual 2
A1        =   Appeal of individual 1 (how much individual 1 is appealing to their partner)
A2        =   Appeal of individual 2
k1        =   Insecurity of individual 1 (Peak of reaction function of 1 on 2, high k1 means they are annoyed by their partner's love earlier)
k2        =   Insecurity of individual 2
n1        =   Shape of reaction function of 1 on 2 (nonlinearity of reaction function of 1 on 2, sensitivity of the individuals' feelings to changes in their partner's feelings)
n2        =   Shape of reaction function of 2 on 1
m1        =   Shape of bias function of 1 (nonlinearity of bias function of 1, sensitivity of how the own feelings influence their perception of their partner's appeal)
m2        =   Shape of bias function of 2
sigma1    =   Saddle quantity of 1 (Trace of Jabobian of 1, threshold of when own feelings influence their perception of their partner's appeal. > 0 for stable, < 0 for unstable)
sigma2    =   Saddle quantity of 2
