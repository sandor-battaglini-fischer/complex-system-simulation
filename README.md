# Romantic Chaos: A study of the emergence of unpredictability in relationships
As part of the course "Complex System Simulation" - University of Amsterdam 2024
Used to support the final presentation of the project. This includes creating grpahs, visualizations and animations, as well as to get a deeper understanding of the model and the dynamics of the model.

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts to create graphs for our final presentation. TO be able to run the scripts see the requirements below. By clicking on the run option in the .py file or running each cell in the .ipynb file, the graphs will be created. 

## File Descriptions

### `triangular.ipynb`
This file includes the plots for the triangular relationships part.

### `external_stress.ipynb`
`external_stress.ipynb` gives the plots for the base model and external stress models.

### `6d.ipynb`
This file sets up basic plotting for the 6D dynamical system based on Sternberg's "Triangular Theory of Love"

### `love_dynamics.ipynb`
Plotting of linear models and Gone with the Wind
