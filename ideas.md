# Modelling love

## Preliminary Structure

1. Basic modelling of romantic relationships (static, periodic, chaotic romantic regimes)
2. Emergence of romantic chaos
3. Triangular Relationships

## Hypothesis

+ Relationsships (Intensity of feelings of non-standard couples*) show different destinies depending on the conditions:
  + Converges to one fixed point (most advantageous for both), or two (one benefits one or the other more) if the appeal/insecurity is unbalanced
  + Enters cycles if there are periodic external influences (weekly, monthly, yearly)
  + Chaos if n>2, or noisy external influences

**Non-standard couples are insecure and unbiased*
