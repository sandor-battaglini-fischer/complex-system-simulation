# Modelling love

## Preliminary Structure

1. Basic modelling of romantic relationships
2. Emergence of romantic chaos by environmental stress
3. Emergence of romantic chaos due to extra emotional dimension (work, inspiration)
4. Emergence of romantic chaos due to Triangular Relationships
5. (Nice to have) Network model for n>3 individuals

## Hypothesis

+ Relationsships (Intensity of feelings of non-standard couples) show different destinies depending on the conditions:
  + **Converges** to one fixed point (most advantageous for both), or two (one benefits one or the other more) if the appeal/insecurity is unbalanced (Game theory??)
  + Enters **cycles** if there are periodic external influences (weekly, monthly, yearly)
  + **Chaos** if n>2, or noisy external influences

**Non-standard couples are insecure and unbiased*
